# Computer Vision Essentials

## Overview
Computer Vision is a field of artificial intelligence that enables machines to interpret and make decisions based on visual data from the world. This involves processing and analyzing images and videos to extract meaningful information.

## Key Computer Vision Libraries

### 1. OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)

#### Overview
- **OpenCV** is a widely used open-source library designed for real-time computer vision applications. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for image processing, computer vision, and machine learning.

#### Key Features
- **Image Processing**: Tools for image manipulation, filtering, transformations, and color space conversions.
- **Object Detection and Recognition**: Pre-trained models for detecting and recognizing objects in images and videos.
- **Feature Detection**: Algorithms for detecting key points and descriptors in images (e.g., SIFT, SURF, ORB).
- **Machine Learning**: Support for various machine learning algorithms for tasks like classification and regression.

#### Installation
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

#### Basic Usage
```python
import cv2

# Load an image
image = cv2.imread('image.jpg')

# Convert to grayscale
gray_image = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Display the image
cv2.imshow('Gray Image', gray_image)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

### 2. ImageAI

#### Overview
- **ImageAI** is a high-level library built on top of TensorFlow and Keras, designed for building computer vision applications easily. It abstracts complex processes, making it accessible for beginners.

#### Key Features
- **Pre-trained Models**: Comes with several pre-trained models for object detection and image recognition.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple API that allows for quick development and integration of computer vision features.
- **Support for Custom Training**: Ability to train custom models on your own datasets.

#### Installation
```bash
pip install imageai
```

#### Basic Usage
```python
from imageai.Detection import ObjectDetection

# Create an Object Detection instance
detector = ObjectDetection()
detector.setModelTypeAsRetinaNet()
detector.setModelPath('retinanet_model.h5')  # Path to pre-trained model
detector.loadModel()

# Perform object detection
detections = detector.detectObjectsFromImage(input_image='input.jpg', output_image='output.jpg')

# Print detected objects
for detection in detections:
    print(f"{detection['name']} : {detection['percentage_probability']}%")
```
