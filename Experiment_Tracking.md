# Experiment Tracking and Model Management Essentials

## Overview
Experiment tracking and model management are crucial aspects of the machine learning workflow. They help in organizing experiments, comparing results, and maintaining versions of models and datasets. Tools like MLflow and Weights & Biases facilitate these processes.

## Key Tools for Experiment Tracking and Model Management

### 1. MLflow

#### Overview
- **MLflow** is an open-source platform that manages the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, including experimentation, reproducibility, and deployment.

#### Key Features
- **Experiment Tracking**: Log metrics, parameters, and artifacts for different experiments, allowing for easy comparison.
- **Model Registry**: Organize and manage models in a central repository with versioning and stage transitions.
- **Projects**: Package code in a reusable and reproducible way, enabling others to run the same experiments.
- **Deployment**: Deploy models to various platforms (e.g., REST API, cloud services).

#### Installation
```bash
pip install mlflow
```

#### Basic Usage
```python
import mlflow

# Start a new MLflow run
with mlflow.start_run():
    # Log parameters
    mlflow.log_param("alpha", 0.5)
    
    # Log metrics
    mlflow.log_metric("rmse", 0.123)
    
    # Log a model (assuming a trained model object)
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "model")
```

### 2. Weights & Biases

#### Overview
- **Weights & Biases** is a cloud-based platform designed for tracking experiments, visualizing metrics, and collaborating across teams in machine learning projects.

#### Key Features
- **Experiment Tracking**: Automatically logs and tracks hyperparameters, metrics, and output files for experiments.
- **Visualization**: Provides rich visualizations for comparing metrics and model performance over time.
- **Collaboration**: Enables team collaboration through shared dashboards and reports, fostering communication.
- **Integration**: Easily integrates with popular machine learning frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.).

#### Installation
```bash
pip install wandb
```

#### Basic Usage
```python
import wandb

# Initialize a new run
wandb.init(project="my_project")

# Log hyperparameters
wandb.config.alpha = 0.5

# Log metrics
wandb.log({"rmse": 0.123})

# Finish the run
wandb.finish()
```
